'author': 'ywkimd', 'date': '2015. 2. 2. 10:32', 'title': '미리 본 김용판 회고록 정치는 삼류 수준', 'content': '‘국정원 여직원 댓글 사건’ 수사를 은폐·축소한 혐의로 기소돼 29일 대법원에서 무죄가 확정된 김용판(57) 전 서울경찰청장은 지난 2년 1개월 동안 수사·재판 과정의 소회를 담은 회고록을 조만간 출간할 예정이다. ‘나는 왜 청문회 선서를 거부했는가’라는 제목의 회고록은 A4 용지 150쪽 분량으로 국정원 여직원 댓글 사건의 실체와 재판 과정, 김 전 청장의 경찰 생활이 담겨 있다. 본지가 단독으로 입수한 회고록에서 김 전 청장은 검찰을 향해 “집단적인 도덕 불감증에 빠졌다”고 했고, 국회에서 대해선 “삼류에 불과하다”며 강하게 비판했다. 사건 당시 수서경찰서 수사과장으로 댓글 사건 수사 은폐·축소를 폭로한 새정치민주연합 권은희 의원에 대한 비판도 상당 부분 할애했다. 그는 권 의원이 경찰을 그만두자 민주당 정세균 의원이 트위터에 ‘김용판 같은 자가 엄벌에 처해지는 것이 상식인 나라, 권은희 과장처럼 정의감 투철한 공무원이 보호받고 존경받을 수 있어야 정상적인 나라’라고 쓴 것을 보고 책을 집필하게 됐다고 했다. 그는 “누가 자신의 책무를 다했고, 누가 정치적 행동을 했는지, 누가 진실을 이야기했고, 누가 거짓으로 일관했는지를 밝혀야한다는 사명감이 들었다”고 적었다. 김용판 전 서울경찰청장. 그는 회고록에서 “국정원 댓글사건은 일부 언론, 단체, 기관, 사람들의 선입견으로 진실은 묻히고 거짓과 위증만이 난무한 사건”이라고 규정했다. 이어 “한 경찰관의 헛된 욕망에 찬 허무맹랑한 폭로에 의해 정치권은 물론 인터넷, 언론, 보수진영과 진보진영, 나아가 좌익진영 등이 총출동해 격한 논란과 상대에 대한 공격이 벌어졌고 국가를 일대 혼란에 빠뜨렸다”고 했다. 1심부터 대법원까지 무죄 선고가 난 데 대해서는 “애당초 야권이 무리한 고발을 하지 않고, 검찰이 냉정하게 판단했다면 재판은 처음부터 이뤄지지 않았을 것”이라며 “증인으로 출석한 한 명의 경찰관이 실체적 진실과 전혀 다른 모순된 폭로와 증언을 하지 않았다면 사건이 이렇게 왜곡되지도 않았을 것”이라고 했다. 김 전 청장은 회고록 제목처럼 2013년 8월 댓글사건 국회 국정조사에서 국회 사상 처음으로 증인선서를 거부한 이유부터 설명했다. 그는 “국회에 대한 불신 때문”이라고 했다. 그는 “국민의 대의기관인 국회를 존중하지만, 당시 국회 특히 야권에 대해서는 불신할 수밖에 없었다. 내가 아무리 당당하게 진실을 말해도 어떤 이유로든 나를 위증죄로 고발할 것이며, 또 다른 재판으로 몰아넣을 것이 분명했다”고 적었다. 이어 “야당은 평소 검찰을 향해 ‘정치검찰’이라며 거세게 공격했음에도 당시 채동욱 총장 체제의 검찰이 나를 기소하자 태도를 180도 바꿔 적극적으로 옹호하는 이중성을 보였다”고 했다. 야당의 ‘마녀사냥’식 행태를 보면서 자신의 말을 믿지 않을 것으로 확신했고, 국정조사 증인 선서를 거부했다는 것이다. 수서경찰서 수사과장으로 있다가 정치권에 진출한 새정치민주연합 권은희 의원. 그는 언론에 대한 섭섭한 마음도 회고록에 적었다. 그는 “피고인 신분이 되어 재판을 받으면서 일부 언론의 희생양이었다”고 했다. 그는 “관련자 2~3명만 만나 두어 시간만 이야기 나누었어도 A의 주장이 얼마나 큰 거짓말인지 금세 알아차렸을 것”이라며 “일부 언론은 처음부터 자기들 입맛대로 사실을 확정해놓고 거기에 따라 기사를 쓴 것”이라고 했다. 김 전 청장은 회고록에서 정치인은 실명(實名)으로 언급했지만 유독 권은희 의원에 대해서는 A로 표현했다. 회고록 출판 때도 A로만 표기할 예정이라고 했다. 새정치민주연합 박지원 의원을 예로 들면서 정치인과 SNS(소셜네트워크 서비스)의 무책임에 대해서도 비판했다. 박지원 의원은 2012년 12월18일 자신의 트위터에 ‘국정원 선거개입 의혹 경찰 인맥? 서울경찰청장 대구생, 영남대 졸, 달성군 경찰서장, 박 후보 집권 시 경찰청장 설?’이라는 내용을 썼다. 이에 대해 김 전 청장은 “기초적인 사실조차 잘못된 허무맹랑한 글이 SNS에 퍼질 때 적극적으로 해명하거나 방어하기 어렵다. 박지원 당시 원내대표는 그 후 사실이 잘못됐다고 정정한 글을 올리지 않았고, 한번 내뱉으면 그만이다는 행위를 공인으로 아무렇지도 않게 자행했다”고 비판했다. 김 전 청장은 박근혜 대통령의 지역구였던 달성군 경찰서장이 아닌 달서경찰서장을 지냈다. 김용판 전 서울경찰청장이 지난 29일 대법원에서 무죄를 확정받은 직후 본지 기자에게 소회를 밝히고 있다. /석남준 기자 자신을 기소한 검찰에 대해서는 “집단적 도덕 불감증에 빠져 있다”며 “검찰이 책무의 관점이 아니라 권력·권한의 관점에 서 있는 게 독선적 형태가 나타난 이유”라고 했다. 정치권에 대해서는 “삼류 수준”이라고 평가절하했다. “한 기업 총수가 ‘대한민국 경제는 이류, 행정은 삼류, 정치는 사류’라고 해 파문을 일으켰다. 2014년 대한민국 정치는 몇류일까. 아무리 점수를 높게 줘도 삼류 이상 되지 못한다”고 했다. 시민단체에 대해서는 “권력을 가지고 있다고 생각하는 것이 문제다. 본래의 목적은 상실하고, 정치화되어 혼란을 부추긴다”고 썼다. 이어 “권력이 싫어서 정부로부터 독립한 시민단체가 권력을 추구하는 행태는 모순”이라고 했다. 노무현 정부 때인 2003년 발생한 ‘천성산 터널 도롱뇽 사건’과 이명박 정부 때 ‘광우병 파동’을 시민단체 해악의 대표 사례로 들었다. 김 전 청장은 ‘A는 왜 편견에 가득 찬 허위 진술을 했을까?’라며 권은희 의원을 정면으로 비판했다. 그는 “검찰과 야권이 A의 허무맹랑한 폭로를 무조건 믿었다. 재판이 처음부터 A라는 한 사람의 허위 증언에 의해 증폭되었다는 점을 많은 국민이 알지 못했다는 점이 아쉬웠다”고 적었다. 그러면서 “A가 증인으로 나와 줄기차게 허위 진술을 했는데 그 허위 진술이 오히려 진실을 밝혀내는 데 큰 도움이 됐다”고 했다. 그는 “국정원 여직원 댓글 사건 초기 ‘수서경찰서의 A가 상황을 잘 파악하고 있더라’고 칭찬을 했고, 격려 전화한 게 외압으로 둔갑했다”고 했다. 김 전 청장이 1심에서 무죄를 선고받자 항소심에서 권 의원은 증언을 일부 바꿨다. 김 전 청장은 “위증을 하는 사람들이 일반적으로 자신의 주장에 설득력을 가미하기 위해 점차 살을 덧붙여 가면서 진술이 오히려 구체화되어 간다는 전형적인 사례와 너무나 일치되고 있음은 과연 우연일까. 정말 소가 웃을 말”이라고 했다.'}\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"x9yaJxFOh2oZ","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":123},"outputId":"c637db6f-4fe6-46d3-aedd-084c275fc490","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1584071191198,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":1853,"user":{"displayName":"­배유나[경영학부]","photoUrl":"","userId":"16097689920782289219"}}},"source":["content_list

“집단적인 도덕 불감증에 빠졌다”고 했고, 국회에서 대해선 “삼류에 불과하다”며 강하게 비판했다. 사건 당시 수서경찰서 수사과장으로 댓글 사건 수사 은폐·축소를 폭로한 새정치민주연합 권은희 의원에 대한 비판도 상당 부분 할애했다. 그는 권 의원이 경찰을 그만두자 민주당 정세균 의원이 트위터에 ‘김용판 같은 자가 엄벌에 처해지는 것이 상식인 나라, 권은희 과장처럼 정의감 투철한 공무원이 보호받고 존경받을 수 있어야 정상적인 나라’라고 쓴 것을 보고 책을 집필하게 됐다고 했다. 그는 “누가 자신의 책무를 다했고, 누가 정치적 행동을 했는지, 누가 진실을 이야기했고, 누가 거짓으로 일관했는지를 밝혀야한다는 사명감이 들었다”고 적었다. 김용판 전 서울경찰청장. 그는 회고록에서 “국정원 댓글사건은 일부 언론, 단체, 기관, 사람들의 선입견으로 진실은 묻히고 거짓과 위증만이 난무한 사건”이라고 규정했다. 이어 “한 경찰관의 헛된 욕망에 찬 허무맹랑한 폭로에 의해 정치권은 물론 인터넷, 언론, 보수진영과 진보진영, 나아가 좌익진영 등이 총출동해 격한 논란과 상대에 대한 공격이 벌어졌고 국가를 일대 혼란에 빠뜨렸다”고 했다. 1심부터 대법원까지 무죄 선고가 난 데 대해서는 “애당초 야권이 무리한 고발을 하지 않고, 검찰이 냉정하게 판단했다면 재판은 처음부터 이뤄지지 않았을 것”이라며 “증인으로 출석한 한 명의 경찰관이 실체적 진실과 전혀 다른 모순된 폭로와 증언을 하지 않았다면 사건이 이렇게 왜곡되지도 않았을 것”이라고 했다. 김 전 청장은 회고록 제목처럼 2013년 8월 댓글사건 국회 국정조사에서 국회 사상 처음으로 증인선서를 거부한 이유부터 설명했다. 그는 “국회에 대한 불신 때문”이라고 했다. 그는 “국민의 대의기관인 국회를 존중하지만, 당시 국회 특히 야권에 대해서는 불신할 수밖에 없었다. 내가 아무리 당당하게 진실을 말해도 어떤 이유로든 나를 위증죄로 고발할 것이며, 또 다른 재판으로 몰아넣을 것이 분명했다”고 적었다. 이어 “야당은 평소 검찰을 향해 ‘정치검찰’이라며 거세게 공격했음에도 당시 채동욱 총장 체제의 검찰이 나를 기소하자 태도를 180도 바꿔 적극적으로 옹호하는 이중성을 보였다”고 했다. 야당의 ‘마녀사냥’식 행태를 보면서 자신의 말을 믿지 않을 것으로 확신했고, 국정조사 증인 선서를 거부했다는 것이다. 수서경찰서 수사과장으로 있다가 정치권에 진출한 새정치민주연합 권은희 의원. 그는 언론에 대한 섭섭한 마음도 회고록에 적었다. 그는 “피고인 신분이 되어 재판을 받으면서 일부 언론의 희생양이었다”고 했다. 그는 “관련자 2~3명만 만나 두어 시간만 이야기 나누었어도 A의 주장이 얼마나 큰 거짓말인지 금세 알아차렸을 것”이라며 “일부 언론은 처음부터 자기들 입맛대로 사실을 확정해놓고 거기에 따라 기사를 쓴 것”이라고 했다. 김 전 청장은 회고록에서 정치인은 실명(實名)으로 언급했지만 유독 권은희 의원에 대해서는 A로 표현했다. 회고록 출판 때도 A로만 표기할 예정이라고 했다. 새정치민주연합 박지원 의원을 예로 들면서 정치인과 SNS(소셜네트워크 서비스)의 무책임에 대해서도 비판했다. 박지원 의원은 2012년 12월18일 자신의 트위터에 ‘국정원 선거개입 의혹 경찰 인맥? 서울경찰청장 대구생, 영남대 졸, 달성군 경찰서장, 박 후보 집권 시 경찰청장 설?’이라는 내용을 썼다. 이에 대해 김 전 청장은 “기초적인 사실조차 잘못된 허무맹랑한 글이 SNS에 퍼질 때 적극적으로 해명하거나 방어하기 어렵다. 박지원 당시 원내대표는 그 후 사실이 잘못됐다고 정정한 글을 올리지 않았고, 한번 내뱉으면 그만이다는 행위를 공인으로 아무렇지도 않게 자행했다”고 비판했다. 김 전 청장은 박근혜 대통령의 지역구였던 달성군 경찰서장이 아닌 달서경찰서장을 지냈다. 김용판 전 서울경찰청장이 지난 29일 대법원에서 무죄를 확정받은 직후 본지 기자에게 소회를 밝히고 있다. /석남준 기자 자신을 기소한 검찰에 대해서는 “집단적 도덕 불감증에 빠져 있다”며 “검찰이 책무의 관점이 아니라 권력·권한의 관점에 서 있는 게 독선적 형태가 나타난 이유”라고 했다. 정치권에 대해서는 “삼류 수준”이라고 평가절하했다. “한 기업 총수가 ‘대한민국 경제는 이류, 행정은 삼류, 정치는 사류’라고 해 파문을 일으켰다. 2014년 대한민국 정치는 몇류일까. 아무리 점수를 높게 줘도 삼류 이상 되지 못한다”고 했다. 시민단체에 대해서는 “권력을 가지고 있다고 생각하는 것이 문제다. 본래의 목적은 상실하고, 정치화되어 혼란을 부추긴다”고 썼다. 이어 “권력이 싫어서 정부로부터 독립한 시민단체가 권력을 추구하는 행태는 모순”이라고 했다. 노무현 정부 때인 2003년 발생한 ‘천성산 터널 도롱뇽 사건’과 이명박 정부 때 ‘광우병 파동’을 시민단체 해악의 대표 사례로 들었다. 김 전 청장은 ‘A는 왜 편견에 가득 찬 허위 진술을 했을까?’라며 권은희 의원을 정면으로 비판했다. 그는 “검찰과 야권이 A의 허무맹랑한 폭로를 무조건 믿었다. 재판이 처음부터 A라는 한 사람의 허위 증언에 의해 증폭되었다는 점을 많은 국민이 알지 못했다는 점이 아쉬웠다”고 적었다. 그러면서 “A가 증인으로 나와 줄기차게 허위 진술을 했는데 그 허위 진술이 오히려 진실을 밝혀내는 데 큰 도움이 됐다”고 했다. 그는 “국정원 여직원 댓글 사건 초기 ‘수서경찰서의 A가 상황을 잘 파악하고 있더라’고 칭찬을 했고, 격려 전화한 게 외압으로 둔갑했다”고 했다. 김 전 청장이 1심에서 무죄를 선고받자 항소심에서 권 의원은 증언을 일부 바꿨다. 김 전 청장은 “위증을 하는 사람들이 일반적으로 자신의 주장에 설득력을 가미하기 위해 점차 살을 덧붙여 가면서 진술이 오히려 구체화되어 간다는 전형적인 사례와 너무나 일치되고 있음은 과연 우연일까. 정말 소가 웃을 말”이라고 했다.',\n"," '국립5·18민주묘지에서 새정치민주연합 당 대표에 출마한 박지원, 박주선, 주승용 최고의원 출마자 국립5·18민주묘지에서 새정치민주연합 당 대표에 출마한 박지원, 박주선, 이인영 의원이 참배 국립5·18민주묘지에서 새정치민주연합 당

이루어내겠습니다. 문재인 의원이 오늘 새정치민주연합의 당 대표 출마를 공식 선언했습니다. 이제 새정치민주연합의 전당대회는 친노 대 비노의 계파 전쟁으로 흐를 가능성이 커졌습니다. 앞서 당 대표 출마를 선언한 박지원 의원은 야당의 유력한 대권 후보로 주목되고 있는 문재인 의원에게 불출마를 요구한 바 있습니다. 전 비서실장 간의 대결이죠. 고 김대중 전 대통령 시절의 비서실장이었던 박지원 의원, 그리고 고 노무현 전 대통령 참여정부 마지막 비서실장인 문재인 의원은 서로 날선 각을 내세워왔는데요. [인터뷰:박지원, 새정치민주연합 의원] 저는 문재인 의원은 우리 새정치민주연합의 중요한 대통령 후보 중에 한 사람이기 때문에, 국민 속으로 들어가서 자기의 정책과 아젠다를 그리고 국민과 몸과 마음을 섞어가길 바랍니다. 문재인 의원은 당을 살리기 위한 결정임을 분명히 했습니다. [인터뷰:문재인, 새정치민주연합 의원] 우리 당을 살리는 데 제 정치인생을 걸겠습니다. 당을 살려내는 데 끝내 실패한다면 정치인 문재인의 시대적 역할은 거기가 끝 이라는 각오로 오늘 이 자리에 섰습니다. 이런 가운데 당 대표 불출마를 선언한 두 사람, 김부겸 전 의원과 정세균 상임고문도 있는데요. 김 전 의원은 아직 당을 이끌만한 지혜와 내공이 부족하다며 고사했고요. 정세균 상임 고문도 역시 출마를 고사했습니다. [인터뷰:정세균, 새정치민주연합 의원] 어떻게 통합하고 어떻게 혁신할 것이냐 하는 이런 경쟁의 장으로 전당대회가 잘 만들어졌으면 좋겠습니다. 문재인 대 박지원, 박지원 대 문재인의 양강 독주 체제가 불가피해진 지금, 계파에 속해있지 않은 다른 의원들도 당 대표에 출마를 선언했는데요. 박주선, 이인영, 조경태 의원은 이미 선언했고요. 박영선, 추미애, 김영환 의원은 현재 고심중에 있습니다. 이들 비계파 의원들이 개혁 카드로 단일화할 경우 이변이 일어날 가능성도 있습니다. 내년 2월8일 전당대회를 앞둔 새정치민주연합. 오늘부터 이틀간 후보 등록을 시작으로 차기 당권 레이스에 돌입합니다. http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;oid=052&amp;aid=0000630887&amp;sid1=001 새정치 전당대회 비노 VS. 친노 계파전쟁 [앵커] [인터뷰:문재인, 새정치민주연합 의원] 피할 수 없다고 결론 내렸습니다. 당을 살리기 위해 몸을 던질 것을 결심했습니다. 저 문재인이 나... news.naver.com',\n"," '박 대통령 국정수행 지지도, 회복세 44.8% 박근혜 대통령 국정수행 평가가 긍정 44.8%, 부정 49.6%로 2014년을 마감했다. 여론조사 전문기관 리얼미터(대표: 이택수)의 2014년 마지막 주 12월 5주차 주간집계에서, 박 대통령의 취임 97주차 국정수행 지지도(긍정평가)는 1주일 전 대비 1.8%p 상승한 44.8%(‘매우 잘함’ 13.3% + ‘잘하는 편’ 31.5%)를 기록했다. 반면 ‘국정수행을 잘못하고 있다’는 부정평가는 0.2%p 하락한 49.6%(‘매우 잘못함’ 31.9% + ‘잘못하는 편’ 17.7%)로 조사됐다. 긍정평가와 부정평가의 격차는 2.0%p 좁혀진 -4.8%p를 기록했다. ‘모름/무응답’은 7.1%p. 지역별로 보면 특히 경기·인천(40.1%→51.1%▲), 부산·경남·울산(47.1%→50.3%▲), 대구·경북(59.6%→63.1%▲)에서 상승폭이 컸고, 연령별로는 20대(19.1%→23.6%▲)와 30대(24.0%→29.9%▲)에서 회복세가 컸다. 성별로는 여성(42.1%→48.4%▲)이, 직업별로는 가정주부(54.3%→63.6%▲), 노동직(52.8%→62.5%▲), 학생(20.8%→31.1%▲) 층에서, 지지정당별로는 무당층(18.7%→25.6%▲)과 새누리당 지지층(83.6%→85.1%▲), 이념성향별로는 중도(32.2%→35.3%▲) 및 보수(70.5%→71.9%▲) 성향에서 올랐다. 반면 대전·충청·세종(50.0%→36.8%▼), 서울(39.7%→38.0%▼) 지역, 50대(56.3%→55.4%▼), 남성(44.0%→41.2%▼), 사무직(30.2%→26.2%▼)과 농림어업(65.0%→45.5%▼), 새정치연합 지지층(13.1%→11.2%▼), 진보성향(23.6%→15.4%▼)에서는 하락한 것으로 조사됐다. 일간으로 보면 박 대통령의 지지율은 29일(월) 42.9%로 출발, 30일(화) 43.5%, 31일(수)45.4%를 거쳐 1월 2일(금) 46.0%까지 지속적으로 상승했는데, 남북 정상 신년사 발표, 대통령 신년 인사회 등에 따른 남북관계 개선을 비롯한, 2015년 국정에 대한 긍정적 기대감이 작용한 것으로 보인다. 한편 2014년 박근혜 대통령의 주간 기준 최고 지지율은 세월호 사고 직후 박 대통령이 사고 현장을 방문해 유가족들과 사고대책을 논의하는 장면이 보도된 4월 3주차 64.7%, 최저 지지율은 ‘비선실세’ 국정개입 의혹 청와대 문건 유출 사건으로 인해 검찰 수사가 본격화된 12월 2주차 39.7%로 기록됐다.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 정당지지도에서는 새누리당이 40.3%, 새정치민주연합이 23.9%, 정의당이 5.6%의 지지율로 2014년을 마감했다. 새누리당은 전 주 대비 0.3%p 하락한 반면, 새정치연합과 정의당은 각각 1.2%p, 1.1%p 상승했다. 새누리당과 새정치연합의 격차는 16.4%p로 1.5%p 좁혀졌고, 무당층은 1.4%p 줄어든 29.5%로 조사됐다. 새누리당은 서울과 대전·충청·세종, 50대 이상, 남성, 사무직·노동직·농림어업, 보수·중도 성향의 유권자 층에서 오른 반면, 경기·인천, 20대와 40대, 여성, 가정주부에서는 내렸다. 새정치연합은 주로 서울과 대전·충청·세종, 50대와 30대, 남성, 자영업, 진보·중도 성향에서 올랐다. 2014년 새누리당의 주간 기준 최고 지지율은 세월호 사고 직후인 4월 3주차 53.4%, 최저 지지율은 세월호 유족들의 청와대 항의 방문이 있었던 5월 1주차 38.1%였다. 새정치연합의 최고 지지율은 창당 후 두 번째 주인 4월 1주차 33.4%, 최저 지지율은 세월호법과 관련해 당내 갈등이 증폭되었던 9월 4주차 18.0%로 집계됐다. 정의당의 2014년 최고 지지율은 7·30 재보궐 선거 직전인 7월 4주차 6.3%, 최저 지지율은 3월 4주차와 4월 1주차 0.8%로 나타났다.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 여야 차기 대선주자 지지도에서는 새정치연합 박원순 서울시장이 1위, 새정치연합 문재인 의원이 2위, 새누리당 김무성 대표가 3위로 2014년을 마감했다. 박원순 시장은 전 주 대비 3.5%p 반등하며 18.1%로 문재인 의원을 밀어내고 1주 만에 다시 1위로 올라섰다. 박원순 시장의 지지율은 거의 전 계층에서 올랐는데, 서울(15.6%→23.2%▲), 경기·인천(14.8%→17.7%▲), 30대(14.9%→24.3%▲)와 20대(21.4%→29.2%▲), 사무직(16.5%→26.5%▲), 무당층(15.6%→22.7%▲), 진보성향(18.1%→32.8%▲) 유권자 층에서 상승폭이 컸다. 성소수자 차별 발언에 대한 실수 인정, 세월호 유가족 위로 방문, 채무 감축을 통한 서울시 재정건전성 향상 보도 등이 지지율 상승에 긍정적 영향을 미쳤고, 특히 지난주 문재인 의원을 지지했던 진보성향의 저연령대 유권자 일부가 이탈해 박원순 시장으로 결집한 것으로 분석된다.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 지난주 박 시장을 제치고 1위에 올랐던 문재인 의원은 0.1%p 하락한 16.2%로 1주 만에 다시 2위로 내려앉았다. 문재인 의원의 지지율 하락은 서울(19.2%→17.2%▼), 20대(30.4%→20.2%▼)와 30대(24.8%→22.6%▼), 여성(16.4%→15.5%▼), 사무직(26.5%→19.1%▼), 무당층(19.7%→14.9%▼), 진보성향(32.1%→26.9%▼)의 유권자 층에서 상대적으로 컸다. 이어 김무성 대표는 0.5%p 하락한 12.2%로, 문재인 의원과 4.0%p 격차로 3위를 유지했다. 중위권에서는 정부·여당의 구속 재벌 가석방 분위기 조성을 비판한 홍준표 지사가 7.4%를 기록, 0.1%p 하락했지만 안철수 전 대표를 밀어내고 조사 이래 처음으로 4위로 올라섰다. 다음으로 김문수 위원장이 0.5%p 하락한 7.1%로 5위를 유지했고, 안철수 전 대표는 1.3%p 하락한 6.4%로 4위에서 6위로 두 계단 내려앉았다.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 하위권에서는 안희정 지사가 0.8%p 상승한 4.4%로 두 계단 뛰어올라 7위를 차지했고, 정몽준 전 대표는 0.7%p 하락하며 4.3%를 기록, 8위로 한 계단 내려앉았다. 마지막으로 남경필 지사가 0.2%p 내린 3.8%로 9위를 기록했다. ‘모름/무응답’은 1.1%p 감소한 19.9%.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 여권 차기주자 지지도에서는 김무성 대표가 0.4%p 하락한 13.8%를 기록했으나 25주째 선두를 유지했고, 김문수 위원장 또한 0.7%p 하락한 9.4%로 2위를 유지했다. 다음으로 홍준표 지사가 8.6%로 0.6%p 하락했지만 3주 연속 3위 자리를 지켰고, 정몽준 전 대표는 0.5%p 하락한 6.8%로 4위를 기록했다. 이어 남경필 지사는 0.9%p 상승한 5.7%로 3주 연속 5위를 유지했고, 이완구 원내대표는 0.1%p 오른 4.1%로 6위로 한 계단 올라섰다. 이어 원희룡 지사는 1.3%p 하락한 3.4%로 7위, 유정복 시장은 1.1%로 8위로 나타났다. ‘모름/무응답’은 2.5%p 증가한 47.1%. 야권 차기주자 지지도에서는 문재인 의원이 1.9%p 상승한 19.7%로 2주 연속 1위 자리를 지켰고, 박원순 시장 또한 16.4%로 1.4%p 올랐지만 2위에 머물렀다. 안철수 전 대표는 8.9%로 0.8%p 하락했지만 1주일 만에 3위를 회복했고, 김부겸 전 의원은 2.8%p 내린 8.4%로 다시 4위로 내려앉았다. 이어 안희정 지사가 0.4%p 하락한 6.1%로 5위를 유지했고, 탈당 후 신당 창당에 합류할 것으로 알려진 정동영 고문이 1.3%p 오른 4.0%, 김영환 의원이 0.9%p 오른 2.5%, 정세균 고문이 2.2%를 기록했다. ‘모름/무응답’은 1.1%p 감소한 31.7%. 이번 주간집계는 2014년 12월 29일부터 2015년 1월 2일까지(1월 1일 제외) 4일간 전국 19세 이상 유권자 2,500명을 대상으로 전화면접(CATI) 및 자동응답전화(ARS) 방식으로 무선전화(50%)와 유선전화(50%) 병행 RDD 방법으로 조사했고, 통계보정은 국가 인구통계에 따른 성, 연령, 지역별 가중치 부여 방식으로 이루어졌다. 통계보정 이후 인구 구성비는 남성 49.6% 여성 50.4%, 20대 17.8% 30대 19.5% 40대 21.7% 50대 19.6% 60대 이상 21.4%, 표본오차는 95% 신뢰수준에서 ±2.2%p이다.
